            <b>Do not be absent.</b>Take notes. Be organized digitally -day 1 ‘til last day in folder. If you have the means -get a second monitor. Get a good keyboard that suits you - your keyboard will be your tool either mechanical or membrane. Learn to optimize your pc to avoid breakdown. Learn from other sources -the ability to google, daily.dev, freecodecamp ). <u>Learn in the big screen.</u> If something is not clear- always ask questions. You should learn how to work with a team. You listen - you will be working with your teammates. Do not be dishearten if things do not go your way. Rest but don’t quit. Don’t expect KodeGo to teach you everything. Coding is an acquired skill - it degrades when you stop.

            <i>I am notion developer,</i> full stack for code reviews and being called for about 2-4 a month. I started to learn on my own and yeah here I am. My focused was on robotics. Hated bureaucracy. More on practicality. Practice what you learn because it will be hard to move forward. <u>People are taking the Bootcamp, they have a why.</u> Programming is not for everyone. <b>People with enough exposure will get it.</b> Getting a proper entry in the industry is as important as practicing your code. Puro terror yung teacher ko hahaha hindi mapagtanungan. Estimate my salary based on my work portfolio. I won’t deny or confirm it. The common why’s of KodeGo Bootcamper’s is the comfort. IT is not comfortable in what you do rather it’s the compensation that makes it comfortable. What’s important is you declare what you do.
