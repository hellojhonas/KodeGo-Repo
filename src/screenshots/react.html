        <h1>React</h1>
        <p>For this setup, it was demonstrated on how react works and how the architecture of the JSX works. It was also shown how Routing works and some hooks such as State Hooks and Use Effect. We used React for our Capstone where I further implemented what was taught in this part of the bootcamp. For demonstration purposes, below is a screenshot of a React Project that we did with Material UI.</p>
