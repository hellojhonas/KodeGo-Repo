        <h1>Getting Started with AWS</h1>
        <p>As a bootcamp student, I've learned that Amazon Web Services (AWS) provides a range of cloud computing services that are widely used for web development. Two of the most important services for web developers are EC2 and RDS.</p>
        <p>EC2 (Elastic Compute Cloud) is a cloud-based computing service that allows developers to create virtual servers in the cloud. These virtual servers, also known as instances, can be used to host web applications, run software, and store data. EC2 instances can be easily scaled up or down based on demand, making it an ideal choice for web applications that require fast and scalable hosting.</p>
        <p>RDS (Relational Database Service) is a cloud-based database service that allows developers to create and manage relational databases in the cloud. RDS provides an easy-to-use and scalable database solution that can be used to store and retrieve data for web applications. RDS supports a range of popular database engines, such as MySQL, PostgreSQL, and Oracle, and provides built-in tools for data backup, replication, and failover.</p>
        <p>Together, EC2 and RDS provide a powerful and flexible solution for web developers looking to build fast, reliable, and scalable web applications. With EC2, developers can quickly and easily create virtual servers in the cloud, while RDS provides a robust and scalable database solution for storing and retrieving data. By using these services together, developers can build web applications that are fast, reliable, and easy to manage, all in the cloud.</p>

        <h6><strong>Down below are screenshots of my AWS Console where I created some EC2 Instance and RDS. We were also taught on how to install web servers on those instances and how to connect to the RDS. </strong></h6>
